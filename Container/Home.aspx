                        We are proud to differentiate itself from other Maersk companies help in&nbsp; 
                        providing each customer with a personal contact. If the customer has any 
                        questions or inquiries, they can turn to their personal N &amp; U contact and/or 
                        their Account Executive. Your assigned account representative will handle all 
                        the details, do the footwork, and get the information you need. They are 
                        familiar with your individual company&#39;s needs and requirements. Compare this to 
                        other companies call centers, and endless transfers from department to 
                        department- resulting in wasted time, inefficency, and frustration over 
                        impersonal service. Our personal customer service procedures lead to quick 
                        resolutions, and we are highly regarded throughout the industry for our customer
